    <p>
      Values are the beliefs that guide how I act and make decisions. Ethics is how I apply those values in real life,
      especially when nobody is forcing me to do the right thing. The four values below are the ones I try to follow
      because they affect my choices, my relationships, and my future.

    <div class="value-block">
      <h2>Discipline</h2>
      <p><span class="label">What it means:</span> Staying consistent, controlling my choices, and doing what needs to be done even when it’s not easy.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Where it comes from:</span> This comes from school responsibilities, sports/work habits, and seeing how consistency leads to results.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Why it’s important to me:</span> Discipline helps me reach long-term goals, stay organized, and build trust with others because I follow through.</p>
      <p><span class="label">If I don’t follow it:</span> I fall behind, waste time, and miss opportunities. Over time it can hurt my grades, my reputation, and my confidence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="value-block">
      <h2>Justice</h2>
      <p><span class="label">What it means:</span> Treating people fairly, respecting rules that protect others, and speaking up when something is wrong.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Where it comes from:</span> I learned it from family expectations, school experiences, and seeing how unfair situations can seriously impact people.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Why it’s important to me:</span> Justice builds trust and respect. Fairness makes teams, friendships, and communities work better.</p>
      <p><span class="label">If I don’t follow it:</span> I could ignore unfairness or contribute to it. That can damage relationships and make people feel unheard or unsafe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="value-block">
      <h2>Honesty</h2>
      <p><span class="label">What it means:</span> Telling the truth, being real with people, and not hiding things just to make myself look better.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Where it comes from:</span> I learned that trust is built on honesty, and that lies usually create bigger problems later.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Why it’s important to me:</span> Honesty gives me credibility with friends, teachers, and coworkers. It also helps me grow because I own mistakes.</p>
      <p><span class="label">If I don’t follow it:</span> Trust breaks fast. Even small lies can snowball, create stress, and hurt how people see me long-term.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="value-block">
      <h2>Kindness / Generosity</h2>
      <p><span class="label">What it means:</span> Being considerate and willing to help people with my time, attention, support, or resources.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Where it comes from:</span> This comes from how I was raised and from seeing that people remember how you treat them.</p>
      <p><span class="label">Why it’s important to me:</span> Kindness builds strong relationships, improves teamwork, and creates a positive environment around me.</p>
      <p><span class="label">If I don’t follow it:</span> I can come off selfish or careless. That can hurt friendships, teamwork, and create negativity that affects everyone.</p>
